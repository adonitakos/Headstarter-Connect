# Headstarter-Connect
Headstarter is a software engineering accelerator program that places a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaborative coding projects. However, at present, the platform lacks key collaboration features. To address this gap, we propose the development of a new service that enables users and teams to schedule and conduct video calls seamlessly within the Headstarter platform. By providing this essential tool, we can enhance the collaborative experience of participants, enabling them to work more efficiently and effectively towards their coding goals.

# Project Requirements
1. React Platform with user authentication where people can log in and be put into groups 
2. Shared calendar scheduler for users to input their times they are not available 
3. Video call feature for groups to be able to talk to one another 
4. Schedule team meetings on the calendar and send email (or some notification) to user before meeting
